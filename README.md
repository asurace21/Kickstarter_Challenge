# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise’s Play fever fell short of its fundraising goal. She would like to see how other plays fared in comparison. 
### Purpose 
To determine the outcomes and trends of plays based on launch date and funding goals.


## Analysis and Challenges

I was able to perform an analysis through a series of charts and graphs based on the data set provided. One of the first challenges encountered was formatting the pivot table in deliverable 1 to show months as row labels. *link* Another issue was using the countifs() function, in deliverable 2, to collect data for a specific integer range. *link*

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Theater outcomes based on launch date concludes that May is the most successful month to release plays, while December is the least successful month. Another conclusion is that regardless of the month, the cancelation rate remains low. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

While determining the outcome of plays based on their respective goals, we can conclude that plays with a budget of $45,000 or more have the highest rate of failure and lowest success rate. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

One limitation of this dataset is that while it provides the success, failure, and cancel rates, it doesn’t give us enough information to determine how any of the media outlets fared in terms of revenue. It also doesn’t provide enough information to determine why the media outlets had the results that they did. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create a bar chart representing the theater outcomes by launch date and goals. We could also use a scatter chart to visualize the difference between outcomes of plays in the US compared to other countries.
